# Android Coding Challenge
This is the app that waits for a "weather" command in voice, and connects to openweathermap API to retrieve the information for Hamburg.

To-Do:
- prettify the interface
- create Espresso tests for this new UI
- enable user selection of the city (the function to retrieve the weather information takes as a parameter the city name, so it is a matter of modifying the UI)
- enable for more information coming from the API to be shown on screen (via a settings page)
